# Mitigating Resource-Exhaustion Attacks (DDoS) on GraphQL APIs: Best Practices and Strategies

One of the most common and devastating attacks or security threats that GraphQL APIs face is resource-exhaustion attacks, also known as Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS). This type of attack floods your GraphQl API server with malicious queries, overwhelming its resources, making it unresponsive and unable the complete the usual request-response lifecycle to genuine users.

In this article, we'll focus on some best practices and strategies to mitigate resource-exhaustion attacks specifically on GraphQl APIs. But before we dive into the solutions, let's first take a closer look at what resource-exhaustion attacks are and how they work.

## What are Resource-Exhaustion Attacks and How do They Impact GraphQL API Server's Performance?

Resource-exhaustion attacks, aka DDoS attacks, are a type of cyber attack in which an attacker floods a server with a high volume of requests in a short period of time. The purpose of such an attack is to exhaust the server's resources and make it unavailable to legitimate users.

In the context of a GraphQL APIs, a resource-exhaustion attack can take many forms. For example, an attacker may send a large number of queries with circular dependencies that are computationally expensive, consuming a significant amount of the server's processing power.

The effect of resource-exhaustion attacks on GraphQL API servers are not limited to technical issues like degraded performance or complete downtimes. Successful attacks can also lead to significant financial and reputational damage.

Now, let's take a look at some code examples to better understand how a this attacks can affect a GraphQL API server, In these examples, we'll use Apollo Server, a popular implementation of GraphQL, and simulate an attack using a tool called [Artillery](https://www.artillery.io/) for sending graphql queries.

### Query with Circular Dependencies

The first example simulates an attack in which an attacker sends a large number of queries with circular dependencies. Circular dependencies occur when a query requires data that is itself dependent on the query. For example, consider the following schema:

> You can find the complete source code for all the examples in this [github repository](https://github.com/huboh/graphql-resource-exhaustion-attack)

```graphql
type User {
  id: ID!
  name: String
  email: String!
  posts: [Post!]!
  ...
}

type Post {
  id: ID!
  title: String!
  author: User!
  content: String!
  isPublished: Boolean!
  ...
}

# The "Query" type is special: it lists all of the available queries
# that clients can execute, along with the return type for each.
type Query {
  me: User
  user(userId: ID): User
  post(userId: ID): Post
}
```

In our schema above, a blog post has an author, and an author(user) has many books. If an attacker sends a query for a user, which in turn requires his/her posts, which requires the author, which in turn require his/her posts again, the server will be stuck in an infinite loop, consuming a significant amount of processing power.

```yaml
config:
  target: "http://localhost:4000/graphql"
  phases:
    - duration: 60
      arrivalRate: 100
  payload:
      method: "POST"
      headers:
        Content-Type: "application/json"
      jsonBody:
        query: "query { user { id name email posts { id title author { id name email posts { id title author { id name email posts { id title author { id name } } } } } } }
}"
```

This configuration sends 100 queries per second for 60 seconds. When we run this configuration against the server, we can see that the CPU usage spikes to 100%, indicating that the server is under attack.

```graphql:schema.graphql showLineNumbers
"""
the Date type represent a date string in ISO format
"""
scalar Date

type User {
  id: ID!
  name: String
  email: String!
  createdAt: Date!
  friends: [User!]!
}
```

```graphql:query.graphql showLineNumbers
query {
  user(id: "ID") {
    friends {
      friends {
        friends {
          friends {
            ...
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

it's very simple to query for heavily nested relationship or using field aliases to query the same field multiple times

Re: I'm writing an article on my personal website titled "Mitigating Resource-Exhaustion Attacks on GraphQL Servers (DDoS)", draft out the first section on the article for me "introduction on resource-exhaustion attacks (DDoS)" give code examples where needed, external links and try to be humorous, informative & formal while at it

In this example, we have a simple function that calculates the nth number in the Fibonacci sequence. However, the function is designed to be very inefficient, which means that it takes a long time to compute the result for larger values of n. The while loop at the bottom of the code continuously calls the fibonacci function with the argument 100, which causes the server to use up all of its CPU resources and become unresponsive.

Of course, this is just a simple example. In a real-world resource-exhaustion attack, the attacker might use a more sophisticated method to overwhelm your server, such as sending a flood of requests to a particular endpoint or using a botnet to coordinate the attack.

In the next section, we'll talk about how GraphQL servers can be particularly vulnerable to resource-exhaustion attacks, and what you can do to mitigate the risk.

Mitigating Resource-Exhaustion Attacks on GraphQL Servers (DDoS)

Have you ever been stuck in traffic on the highway during rush hour? It's frustrating, isn't it? Well, imagine if that same kind of gridlock happened to your website or server. That's essentially what a DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attack does: it overwhelms your server with so much traffic that it can't keep up, effectively shutting down your website or service.

DDoS attacks can come in many different forms, but they all have the same goal: to consume all of your server's resources and prevent legitimate users from accessing your service. One of the most common types of DDoS attacks is the resource-exhaustion attack, which focuses on overwhelming a particular resource on your server, such as the CPU or memory.

In this article, we'll focus specifically on resource-exhaustion attacks on GraphQL servers, and discuss ways to mitigate the risk. But first, let's take a closer look at how resource-exhaustion attacks work.

## How Resource-Exhaustion Attacks Work

Resource-exhaustion attacks work by overwhelming a particular resource on your server. For example, an attacker might send a flood of requests to a particular endpoint, or use a botnet to coordinate the attack. In the case of a GraphQL server, an attacker might send queries that are specifically designed to consume large amounts of resources.

Let's take a look at an example. Consider the following GraphQL query:

```graphql
query {
  allUsers {
    nodes {
      id
      username
      email
      avatarUrl
      posts {
        nodes {
          title
          content
          comments {
            nodes {
              id
              text
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

This query is designed to fetch a lot of data from the server, including all the users, their posts, and the comments on those posts. If an attacker were to send a flood of queries like this to your GraphQL server, it could quickly consume all of your server's resources and cause it to become unresponsive.

Of course, this is just a simple example. In a real-world resource-exhaustion attack, the attacker might use a more sophisticated method to overwhelm your server. But the basic principle is the same: the attacker is trying to consume all of your server's resources to prevent legitimate users from accessing your service.

## Mitigating Resource-Exhaustion Attacks on GraphQL Servers

So how can you protect your GraphQL server from resource-exhaustion attacks? Here are a few strategies to consider:

### 1. Implement Query Depth Limits

One way to prevent resource-exhaustion attacks is to implement query depth limits. This means that you set a limit on how deep a GraphQL query can go, so that it can't fetch an unlimited amount of data from your server.

To implement query depth limits in your GraphQL server, you can use a tool like graphql-depth-limit. This tool allows you to set a maximum depth for your GraphQL queries, so that any queries that go deeper than the limit will be rejected.

Here's an example of how you can use graphql-depth-limit in your GraphQL server:

```js
const express = require("express");
const { graphqlHTTP } = require("express-graphql");
const depthLimit = require("graphql-depth-limit");
const schema = require("./schema");

const app = express();

app.use(
  "/graphql",
  graphqlHTTP({
    schema,
    validationRules: [depthLimit(5)],
  })
);
```

In this example, we're using the express-graphql package to set up a GraphQL endpoint on our server. We're also using the graphql-depth-limit package to set a maximum

depth of 5 for our queries, meaning that any queries that go deeper than 5 levels will be rejected.

### 2. Use Query Complexity Analysis

Another strategy for mitigating resource-exhaustion attacks is to use query complexity analysis. This means that you analyze each GraphQL query that comes into your server, and assign it a complexity score based on factors like the number of fields being requested, the depth of the query, and the number of variables being used.

To implement query complexity analysis in your GraphQL server, you can use a tool like graphql-query-complexity. This tool allows you to set a maximum complexity for your GraphQL queries, so that any queries that exceed the limit will be rejected.
Here's an example of how you can use graphql-query-complexity in your GraphQL server:

```js
const express = require("express");
const { graphqlHTTP } = require("express-graphql");
const { QueryComplexity } = require("graphql-query-complexity");
const schema = require("./schema");

const app = express();

app.use(
  "/graphql",
  graphqlHTTP((req, res, graphQLParams) => {
    return {
      schema,
      validationRules: [
        new QueryComplexity({
          maximumComplexity: 1000,
          variables: graphQLParams.variables,
          onComplete: (complexity) => {
            console.log(`Query complexity: ${complexity}`);
          },
        }),
      ],
    };
  })
);
```

In this example, we're using the express-graphql package to set up a GraphQL endpoint on our server. We're also using the graphql-query-complexity package to set a maximum complexity score of 1000 for our queries. Any queries that exceed this limit will be rejected.

### 3. Rate Limit Your GraphQL Endpoint

Another strategy for mitigating resource-exhaustion attacks is to rate limit your GraphQL endpoint. This means that you set a limit on the number of requests that can be made to your endpoint within a certain period of time, so that an attacker can't overwhelm your server with too many requests at once.

To implement rate limiting in your GraphQL server, you can use a tool like express-rate-limit. This tool allows you to set a maximum number of requests per IP address within a certain time period.

Here's an example of how you can use express-rate-limit in your GraphQL server:

```js
const express = require("express");
const { graphqlHTTP } = require("express-graphql");
const rateLimit = require("express-rate-limit");
const schema = require("./schema");

const app = express();

const limiter = rateLimit({
  windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minutes
  max: 100, // limit each IP to 100 requests per windowMs
});

app.use(
  "/graphql",
  limiter,
  graphqlHTTP({
    schema,
  })
);
```

In this example, we're using the express-graphql package to set up a GraphQL endpoint on our server. We're also using the express-rate-limit package to set a limit of 100 requests per IP address within a 15-minute period. Any requests that exceed this limit will be rejected.

## Conclusion

DDoS attacks can be a serious threat to any online service, and resource-exhaustion attacks are a common form of DDoS attack. By implementing strategies like query depth limits, query complexity analysis, and rate limiting, you can help protect your GraphQL server from these types of attacks.

Of course, there's no guarantee that these strategies will completely prevent DDoS attacks from occurring. But by taking proactive measures to protect your server, you'll be in a better position to weather

## ----------

The impact of a resource-exhaustion attacks can be severe, ranging from degraded performance to complete downtime. It can also lead to loss of revenue and reputation damage to the API's service provider. Theses attacks aren't specific to GraphQL alone, but when designing GraphQL schemas, one has to be extra careful about them and try as much as you possibly can to eliminate circular dependencies between your GraphQL schema types as this is how this certain vulnerability is introduced into your API.
